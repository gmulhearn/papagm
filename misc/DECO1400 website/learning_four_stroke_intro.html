		<h2>1. Four-Stroke Cycle: Introduction</h2>
			<section class = "learning-content">
					<img src = "images/engineIntro.png" alt = "car cylinder image">					
				<p>A four-stroke cycle engine is an internal combustion engine that utilizes four distinct piston strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust) to complete one operating cycle. The piston make two complete passes in the cylinder to complete one operating cycle. An operating cycle requires two revolutions (720Â°) of the crankshaft. The four-stroke cycle engine is the most common type of small engine. A four-stroke cycle engine completes four Strokes in one operating cycle, including intake, compression, combustion and exhaust Strokes.</p>
				<p><br>In 1885, they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine which implemented the four stroke cycle for the first time ever. Since then, the four-stroke engine has maintained its status as the most popular car engine type. However, other engine types, such as rotarys, are still commercially avaliable today.</p>
