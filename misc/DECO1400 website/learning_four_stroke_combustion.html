		<h2>4. Four-Stroke Cycle: The Combustion Stroke.</h2>
		<section class = "learning-content">
				<img src = "images/combustionStrokeThumbnail.png" alt = "diagram of combustion stroke">	
				<p>The ignition (combustion) event occurs when the charge is ignited and rapidly oxidized through a chemical reaction to release heat energy. Combustion is the rapid, oxidizing chemical reaction in which a fuel chemically combines with oxygen in the atmosphere and releases energy in the form of heat.</p>
				<br><p>Following this ignition from the sparkplug, is the power stroke. The power stroke is an engine operation Stroke in which hot expanding gases force the piston head away from the cylinder head. Piston force and subsequent motion are transferred through the connecting rod to apply torque to the crankshaft. The torque applied initiates crankshaft rotation. The amount of torque produced is determined by the pressure on the piston, the size of the piston, and the throw of the engine. During the power Stroke, both valves are closed.</p>
