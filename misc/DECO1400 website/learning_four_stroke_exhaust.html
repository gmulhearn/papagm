		<h2>5. Four-Stroke Cycle: The Exhaust Stroke.</h2>
		<section class = "learning-content">
				<img src = "images/exhaustStrokeThumbnail.png" alt = "diagram of exhaust stroke">	
				<p>The exhaust stroke occurs whenspent gases are expelled from the combustion chamber and released to the atmosphere. The exhaust stroke is the final stroke and occurs when the exhaust valve is open and the intake valve is closed. Piston movement evacuates exhaust gases to the atmosphere.</p>
				<br><p>As the piston reaches BDC during the power stroke combustion is complete and the cylinder is filled with exhaust gases. The exhaust valve opens, and inertia of the flywheel and other moving parts push the piston back to TDC, forcing the exhaust gases out through the open exhaust valve. At the end of the exhaust stroke, the piston is at TDC and one operating cycle has been completed.</p>
